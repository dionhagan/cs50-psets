8.  BYTE = 8; DWORD, LONG = 32; WORD = 16;
9.  0x42 and 0x4d
10. bfSize is the size of the file while biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct
11. image is upside down vertically
12. biBitCount
13. this happens if the user doesn't have permission to write to the directory
14. we always want to read in one structure at a time
